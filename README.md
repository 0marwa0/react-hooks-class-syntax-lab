# React Class Syntax Lab

## Objectives

- Practice refactoring function components to class components

## Instructions

In this lab is the working code from a previous lab, using function components.
If you run the tests now, they should all pass. Your goal is to refactor all the
components in the `src/components` directory to use classes instead of
functions, and _still_ have the tests passing.

Good luck!
